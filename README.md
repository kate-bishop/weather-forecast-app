# weather-forecast-app
A single-page app to display the weather forecast for the week.

Built as part of a coding challenge to match design requirements from Sketch file (see PDF-version of design [here](src/shared/static/WeatherApp.pdf)).

Functional requirements include:
- Data fetched from Open Weather Map API
- Support for imperial & metric
- Responsive to screen size changes
